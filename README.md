## Phases

### Phase 1 - Basics
The idea behind this phase is to introduce everyone to the basics while creating MVP.

#### Spring, Security, AWS, GCP, Azure, REST API
The aim of this phase is to introduce developers to Spring, AWS, GCP, Azure and REST API best practices.
This phase is split in multiple steps explained bellow.

##### Business Case
Develop a secure platform agnostic REST API that will keep track of company vendors under assumption that
it will run locally.

##### Step 1
Create Spring framework platform agnostic application that will expose REST API for managing company vendors.

##### Step 2
Tweak the platform to consume the least possible resources from each of the cloud providers.
The goal of this is for engineering team and DevOps team to learn and understand the pros and cons for 
each cloud platform and to begin constant practice of working together.

##### Step 3
Secure the whole platform using identity management depending on the platform where it will be deployed.

### Phase 2 - Consuming REST API
